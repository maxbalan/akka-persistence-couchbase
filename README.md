Replicated [Akka Persistence](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.6/scala/persistence.html) journal and snapshot store backed by [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/).

Dependencies
------------

### Latest release

To include the latest release of the Couchbase plugins into your `sbt` project, add the following lines to your `build.sbt` file:

    resolvers += "Product-Foundry at bintray" at "http://dl.bintray.com/productfoundry/maven"

    libraryDependencies += "com.productfoundry" %% "akka-persistence-couchbase" % "0.5"

This version of `akka-persistence-couchbase` depends on Akka 2.4.6 and Scala 2.11.8.

It is tested with Couchbase 3.1.0.

Journal plugin
--------------

### Features

- All operations required by the Akka Persistence [journal plugin API](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.6/scala/persistence.html#journal-plugin-api) are fully supported.
- The plugin uses Couchbase in a pure log-oriented way i.e. data are only ever inserted but never updated (deletions are made using deletion markers, rather than performing physical deletion).
- Batches are stored in a single Couchbase message to maintain atomicity.

### Configuration

To activate the journal plugin, add the following line to your Akka `application.conf`:

    akka.persistence.journal.plugin = "couchbase-journal"

This will run the journal with its default settings. The default settings can be changed with the configuration properties defined in [reference.conf](https://github.com/Product-Foundry/akka-persistence-couchbase/blob/master/src/main/resources/reference.conf).

### Caveats

- Not yet tested under very high loads.

Snapshot store plugin
---------------------

### Features

- Implements the Akka Persistence [snapshot store plugin API](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.6/scala/persistence.html#snapshot-store-plugin-api).

### Configuration

To activate the snapshot-store plugin, add the following line to your Akka `application.conf`:

    akka.persistence.snapshot-store.plugin = "couchbase-snapshot-store"

This will run the snapshot store with its default settings. The default settings can be changed with the configuration properties defined in [reference.conf](https://github.com/Product-Foundry/akka-persistence-couchbase/blob/master/src/main/resources/reference.conf).
